# Granting IAM Access to Amazon ECR for a User

To grant an IAM user access to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), you'll need to create or modify an IAM policy and attach it to the user. Here's how to do it:

## Option 1: Using Managed Policies (Simplest Approach)

1. **Attach the AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser policy** (recommended for most users):
   - This provides full read/write access to ECR repositories
   - Go to IAM console → Users → Select user → "Add permissions"
   - Choose "Attach existing policies directly"
   - Search for and select `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser`

2. **Alternative managed policies**:
   - `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`: Read-only access
   - `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess`: Full administrative access

## Option 2: Custom IAM Policy (More Granular Control)

If you need more specific permissions, create a custom policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
                "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
                "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
                "ecr:GetRepositoryPolicy",
                "ecr:DescribeRepositories",
                "ecr:ListImages",
                "ecr:DescribeImages",
                "ecr:BatchGetImage",
                "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload",
                "ecr:UploadLayerPart",
                "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
                "ecr:PutImage"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

For repository-specific access, replace `"Resource": "*"` with ARNs of specific repositories.

## Option 3: Using Permission Boundaries (Advanced)

For more secure setups, you can combine these with permission boundaries to limit what the user can do.

## Verification

After assigning permissions, the user can verify access by:
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com
```

Remember that ECR also requires the user to have permissions to get an authorization token (`ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`), which is included in all the above options.

Push/pull access to a specific repository:
 "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:123456789012:repository/my-app-repo"


Required IAM Actions for Image Deletion
Basic Delete Permission:

json
```
"ecr:BatchDeleteImage"
```

Example IAM Policy for Image Deletion
Here's a complete policy that allows deleting images from a specific repository:


```
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:BatchDeleteImage",
                "ecr:ListImages",
                "ecr:DescribeImages"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:<region>:<account-id>:repository/<repository-name>"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```



This JSON snippet is part of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, specifically defining a permission rule. Let's break it down:

### Explanation:
1. **`"Effect": "Allow"`**  
   - This means the rule is granting permission (as opposed to `"Deny"`, which would explicitly block access).

2. **`"Action": "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken"`**  
   - This specifies the action being permitted. Here, it allows the `GetAuthorizationToken` API operation for Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).  
   - This action is used to retrieve a temporary authentication token for accessing private Docker images in ECR.

3. **`"Resource": "*"`**  
   - The wildcard (`*`) means this permission applies to *all* ECR resources in the AWS account (repositories, images, etc.).  
   - Since `GetAuthorizationToken` is an account-level API (not tied to a specific repository), the wildcard is typically used here.

### Use Case:
This permission is commonly attached to:  
- IAM roles for CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) that need to pull/push Docker images.  
- Kubernetes worker nodes (via the `aws-node` service account) to fetch private ECR images.  

### Security Note:
While `"Resource": "*"` might seem overly permissive, `GetAuthorizationToken` is harmless alone—it doesn’t grant direct access to repositories. However, the token it returns can be used with Docker to access images, so it should still be restricted to trusted entities.  

### Example Full Policy:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
